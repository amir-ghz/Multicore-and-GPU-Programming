# parallel algorithms course Projects

This repository contains implementations and results of the projects of my parallel algorithms course Projects. Some of these projects are:

 - [pi constant and matrix-matrix multiplication](https://github.com/amir-ghz/Multicore-and-GPU-Programming/tree/main/pi%20constant%20and%20mat-mat%20multiply): it is shown how parallelism can speed up the matrix multiplication and whether to use parallelism in every implementation. In this particular assignment, we are first going to
    analyze parallelism for matrix multiplication and then analyze an approximation on Pi value using
    4/(1+x^2) integral.

 - [Particle Simulation in parallel](https://github.com/amir-ghz/Multicore-and-GPU-Programming/tree/main/Particle%20Simulation%20in%20parallel): In this project, we simulate particle interaction. First, we run the algorithm in serial, then we exploit parallelism using OpenMP, and we benefit from parallelism using pthreads.

 - [Matrix Matrix Multiplication Speedup](https://github.com/amir-ghz/Multicore-and-GPU-Programming/tree/main/Matrix%20Matrix%20Multiplication%20Speedup): We'll use OpenMP to create several different parallel applications, each one using a slightly different approach to parallelizing the work. Using OpenMP, the maximum speedup and the number of threads that gave us that speedup are quantitatively evaluated.
